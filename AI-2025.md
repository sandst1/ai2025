## January 2025

### DeepSeek R1 - The "Sputnik Moment"

On January 20, Chinese AI company DeepSeek released R1, a reasoning model that matched OpenAI o1's performance at a fraction of the cost. This release sent shockwaves through the AI industry and broader markets.

**Technical Specifications:**
- 671 billion total parameters using Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture
- 37 billion parameters active per forward pass, enabling efficient inference
- Training cost of approximately $5.6 million vs billions for comparable Western models
- MIT license with fully open-source weights and detailed technical paper

**Key Innovation: Pure RLVR**

The breakthrough innovation was using pure Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) without supervised fine-tuning. Models learned problem-solving strategies autonomously through RL optimization rather than imitating human reasoning patterns. This marked a paradigm shift from scaling pretraining to longer RL runs with verifiable rewards.

**Benchmark Performance:**
- 79.8% on AIME (American Invitational Mathematics Examination)
- 97.3% on MATH-500 benchmark
- 2,029 Elo rating on Codeforces competitive programming

**Market Impact:**

DeepSeek became the #1 iOS app by January 27 and caused an 18% single-day drop in Nvidia stock (approximately $600B market cap loss - the largest single-day loss in history). The release sparked widespread "Sputnik moment" discussions about US AI dominance and efficiency in AI development.

### OpenAI o3-mini Release

On January 31, OpenAI released o3-mini, their latest reasoning model with enhanced capabilities. Positioned as a cost-effective alternative to o1, it demonstrated the company's continued push into test-time compute scaling.

**Hybrid Architecture:**

Unlike competitors offering separate reasoning and standard models, Claude 3.7 Sonnet provided user-controlled reasoning budget with up to 128K thinking tokens. This philosophy positioned reasoning as an integrated capability rather than a separate model.

**State-of-the-Art Coding:**
- 62.3% on SWE-bench Verified (vs o3-mini's 49.3%)
- 81.2% on TAU-Bench for agentic tasks
- 45% reduction in unnecessary refusals vs Claude 3.5 Sonnet

**Claude Code Launch:**

Alongside the model release, Anthropic launched Claude Code (research preview) - a terminal-based agentic coding tool that runs on localhost with private environment access. It can search/read code, edit files, write/run tests, and commit to GitHub, representing a shift from cloud containers to local developer environments.

### Grok 3 Release

On February 17-18, xAI released Grok 3, their flagship model developed in just 18 months by a small team. Trained on the 200,000 GPU Colossus cluster with 10x more compute than Grok 2.
